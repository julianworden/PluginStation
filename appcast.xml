                <ul>
                <li>Fix a bug where a superseded plugin system warning would show up for plugins that have the superseded and superseding plugin installed. No longer will a warning be shown for a superseded plugin if the latest plugin that supersedes it is installed</li>
                <li>Fix a bug where the app does not properly handle plugins that have the same name as another plugin in the database. This is now handled properly both during plugin scanning, and when changes happen during and not during app operation</li>
                <li>Fix 2 bugs in the screen that shows when plugin changes are made when the app is or is not running. The first was showing irrelevant installed version change data when a single format for a plugin was uninstalled/installed. The second was affecting what would happen if 2 plugins with the same name were changed at the same time. Only one of the 2 plugins was showing up, now both are.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Fix bugs with installed DAW scanning and presentation. <strong>In order for these changes to take effect, the user must rescan their installed DAWs in Settings &gt; Installed Software &gt; Rescan Installed DAWs</strong>
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fix a bug where, for users with certain installed DAWs, Plugin Station would indicate that other versions of those DAWs are installed, even though they aren't
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fix an issue in the Installed DAWs tab where users with many installed DAWs will not see all of their installed DAWs
                        </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users will now receive an email, a macOS system notification, and a notification in the Notifications tab of Plugin Station when new plugins that they have installed are added to the Plugin Station database. These notifications serve to inform the user that they can now perform more operations with these plugins, and they are sent in batches by the Plugin Station admin that's performing the plugin creation. Clicking one of these system notifications will open Plugin Station and take the user to a screen with more details about it.
                    </li>
