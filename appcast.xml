                <h3>v1.1.1 (09/10/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix a bug where the icon was not appearing for the System Profiles tab in App Settings for macOS Ventura and Sonoma</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug in Uninstall Assistant on macOS Ventura where the uninstall window would reappear and become undismissable after uninstalling plugins</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug where the user would see an error message after launching the app if they did not have one of the default plugin folders on their system</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.1.0 (09/09/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>NEW FEATURE: Plugin Station now features a tab in the left sidebar named Uninstall Assistant, which allows the user to uninstall many plugins at a time</li>
                    <li>The user is no longer required to open a Finder window to delete plugin files. Instead, Plugin Station handles plugin uninstallation automatically</li>
                    <li>The app now shows a message in the bottom left corner when installed plugins are altered, as opposed to instantly updating when a change is detected. The user has to click this message in order to sync the changes</li>
                    <li>The user is no longer prompted to use an installation manager for uninstalling if that installation manager is not capable of uninstalling plugins</li>
                    <li>Manufacturer logos are now cached so that when they appear shortly after having already appeared, they load instantly</li>
                    <li>Show the user which plugin's data is being updated while the app is updating detected plugin changes</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug on macOS Ventura where Filter and Sort Options popups repeatedly appear and dismiss after clicking the button to present them</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug where uninstalling or installing many plugins at a time while the app is running was causing unexpected behavior</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.0.14 (08/15/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix bug where an Out-Of-Date Plugins System Warning would show plugin formats as being out of date even if they weren't, but another one was. For example, if a plugin's VST file was out of date it would show that, but it would also show the VST3, AU, and AAX files as being out of date, even if they weren't</li>
                    <li>Clicking an Out-Of-Date Plugin Notification will now open up that notification in the Notifications list within the app</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug where an error message regarding an unexpectedly missing "Installed Manufacturer" would appear for some users after making changes to installed plugins during and not during app operation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.0.13 (08/15/25)</h3>

                    <li>Fix bug where some plugins were appearing multiple times in the installed plugins list</li>
                    <li>Fix bug where some DAWs were unexpectedly going undetected during DAW scanning. NOTE: If you were experiencing this issue, please rescan your DAWs via Settings > Installed Software > Rescan Installed DAWs so that Plugin Station can detect your previously unreecognized DAWs</li>
                    <li>Fix bug where DAW version numbers were not being formatted correctly</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.0.12 (08/14/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>NEW FEATURE: Due to popular demand, you can now "Ignore" plugins in System Warnings! Simply click the Ignore button next to a plugin in a System Warning to ignore it, or use the checkboxes to select and ignore multiple plugins at a time. NOTE: Only recognized plugins with known manufacturer information can be ignored, and ignoring a plugin will stop it from triggering any and all system warnings</li>
                    <li>Add a "Release Notes" button to the Plugin Station tab in the macOS Menu Bar. Click this button to open your browser and view a page where you can see the release notes for every version of Plugin Station</li>

                    <li>Fix a bug where a superseded plugin system warning would show up for plugins that have the superseded and superseding plugin installed. No longer will a warning be shown for a superseded plugin if the latest plugin that supersedes it is installed</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug where the app does not properly handle plugins that have the same name as another plugin in the database. This is now handled properly both during plugin scanning, and when changes happen during and not during app operation</li>
                    <li>Fix 2 bugs in the screen that shows when plugin changes are made when the app is or is not running. The first was showing irrelevant installed version change data when a single format for a plugin was uninstalled/installed.

                    <li>Fix bug where enabling the Manufacturer filter for plugins but not actually selecting a manufacturer would cause a "Failed to perform search, received unexpected response with code: 400. Please try again." error message.</li>
