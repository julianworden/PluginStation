                <ul>
                    <li>NEW FEATURE: Due to popular demand, you can now "Ignore" plugins in System Warnings! Simply click the Ignore button next to a plugin in a System Warning to ignore it, or use the checkboxes to select and ignore multiple plugins at a time.

                    <li>Add a "Release Notes" button to the Plugin Station tab in the macOS Menu Bar. Click this button to open your browser and view a page where you can see the release notes for every version of Plugin Station</li>
