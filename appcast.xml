            <description><![CDATA[
                <h3>v1.1.4 (10/02/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement macOS 26 (Tahoe) Support</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implement a new app icon that visually changes depending on how the user has set the appearance of their icons. For example, if the user sets their icons to appear in Dark mode, Plugin Station's icon will now have a black background with blue in the outlet holes. While icon appearance does not change between modes for users running macOS Ventura through Sequoia, these users will notice that the tag on the Plugin Station icon's plug now appears blue instead of red</li>
                            <li>Adopt the new Liquid Glass design language introduced by Apple. Users running macOS 26.0 and later will now see these new Liquid Glass design elements in Plugin Station</li>
                            <li>Make various, subtle changes so that some elements of the app are more readable and glanceable on macOS Tahoe</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Implement support for plugins manufacturered by Waves</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Plugin Station will now detect the .bundle Waves plugin files installed on the user's system in /Applications/Waves. Existing users with Waves plugins already installed should see the app sync these plugins with their account the first time they run Plugin Station 1.1.4</li>
                            <li>Plugin Station can perform the same operations with these plugins as it can with plugins from other manufacturers, the only exception being uninstalling individual plugin formats. It is not possible to, for example, uninstall only the VST3 file for a Waves plugin because Waves does not make their VST3, AU, and AAX plugin files visible for each individual plugin. Instead, they install .bundle files that contain each format, along with WaveShell files that interface with DAWs to load these .bundle files.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.1.3 (09/18/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix a bug where the app was properly detecting installed plugin changes and notifying the user about them, but was not actually making the correct, corresponding change to the user's account for some plugins. If you were experiencing this issue, please check on the plugins in question after installing this update. If you still experience issues, perform an installed plugin rescan in Settings > Installed Software > Rescan Installed Plugins and you should not see this issue again. If you do, please contact support@julianmichaeltechnologies.com</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug in the out-of-date plugins system warning. Next to the manufacturer of each out-of-date plugin, the app displays a button indicating the best way to get the latest version of that manufacturer's plugins. In cases where there were multiple options for getting the latest version, the button was performing the right action, but it was not labeled properly. For example, in some cases it would tell the user to open an installation manager when it should've told the user to open the manufacturer's Downloads page</li>
                    <li>Add clearer messaging during app startup to explain to the user what's happening in the event of a slower-than-usual startup time</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.1.2 (09/14/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix a bug where the app would sometimes tell the user that their plugins are out of sync, even though they aren't. This would usually be triggered by navigating through plugin folders in Finder without actually making any changes to any files</li>
                    <li>Fix searching so that it returns a max of 25 results instead of the default 10.</li>
                    <li>Fix bug in Storage Manager where "Total Hard Drive" had a chart color assigned to it even though that color would never actually appear in the chart since it was covered by all the other colors</li>
                    <li>Make it so that black and white cannot be chart colors in Storage Manager because, depending on the user's color scheme, they will not be visible</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug on macOS Ventura where searching for plugins will sometimes flicker the fetched plugins, and then show others as if no search occurred</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug on macOS Ventura where opening the Browse Plugins or Installed Plugins List will sometimes cause a loop where batches are repeatedly fetched back to back, as opposed to the intended behavior where more plugins only load if the user scrolls down</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug on macOS Ventura where many buttons were not sizing properly and were appearing vertically shorter than intended</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug on macOS Ventura where, after rescanning DAWs, the window that appears would truncate most of its content instead of showing the user the DAWs that were found</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.1.1 (09/10/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix a bug where the icon was not appearing for the System Profiles tab in App Settings for macOS Ventura and Sonoma</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug in Uninstall Assistant on macOS Ventura where the uninstall window would reappear and become undismissable after uninstalling plugins</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug where the user would see an error message after launching the app if they did not have one of the default plugin folders on their system</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.1.0 (09/09/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>NEW FEATURE: Plugin Station now features a tab in the left sidebar named Uninstall Assistant, which allows the user to uninstall many plugins at a time</li>
                    <li>The user is no longer required to open a Finder window to delete plugin files. Instead, Plugin Station handles plugin uninstallation automatically</li>
                    <li>The app now shows a message in the bottom left corner when installed plugins are altered, as opposed to instantly updating when a change is detected. The user has to click this message in order to sync the changes</li>
                    <li>The user is no longer prompted to use an installation manager for uninstalling if that installation manager is not capable of uninstalling plugins</li>
                    <li>Manufacturer logos are now cached so that when they appear shortly after having already appeared, they load instantly</li>
                    <li>Show the user which plugin's data is being updated while the app is updating detected plugin changes</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug on macOS Ventura where Filter and Sort Options popups repeatedly appear and dismiss after clicking the button to present them</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug where uninstalling or installing many plugins at a time while the app is running was causing unexpected behavior</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.0.14 (08/15/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix bug where an Out-Of-Date Plugins System Warning would show plugin formats as being out of date even if they weren't, but another one was. For example, if a plugin's VST file was out of date it would show that, but it would also show the VST3, AU, and AAX files as being out of date, even if they weren't</li>
                    <li>Clicking an Out-Of-Date Plugin Notification will now open up that notification in the Notifications list within the app</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug where an error message regarding an unexpectedly missing "Installed Manufacturer" would appear for some users after making changes to installed plugins during and not during app operation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.0.13 (08/15/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix bug where some plugins were appearing multiple times in the installed plugins list</li>
                    <li>Fix bug where some DAWs were unexpectedly going undetected during DAW scanning. NOTE: If you were experiencing this issue, please rescan your DAWs via Settings > Installed Software > Rescan Installed DAWs so that Plugin Station can detect your previously unreecognized DAWs</li>
                    <li>Fix bug where DAW version numbers were not being formatted correctly</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.0.12 (08/14/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>NEW FEATURE: Due to popular demand, you can now "Ignore" plugins in System Warnings! Simply click the Ignore button next to a plugin in a System Warning to ignore it, or use the checkboxes to select and ignore multiple plugins at a time. NOTE: Only recognized plugins with known manufacturer information can be ignored, and ignoring a plugin will stop it from triggering any and all system warnings</li>
                    <li>Add a "Release Notes" button to the Plugin Station tab in the macOS Menu Bar. Click this button to open your browser and view a page where you can see the release notes for every version of Plugin Station</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>v1.0.11 (08/11/25)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fix a bug where a "Trouble reaching the Branch servers, please try again shortly." error message was occasionally being shown to some users when clicking a plugin in the Browse Plugins list</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>v1.0.10 (08/08/25)</h3>
                <ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Fix a bug where a superseded plugin system warning would show up for plugins that have the superseded and superseding plugin installed. No longer will a warning be shown for a superseded plugin if the latest plugin that supersedes it is installed</li>
                    <li>Fix a bug where the app does not properly handle plugins that have the same name as another plugin in the database. This is now handled properly both during plugin scanning, and when changes happen during and not during app operation</li>
                    <li>Fix 2 bugs in the screen that shows when plugin changes are made when the app is or is not running. The first was showing irrelevant installed version change data when a single format for a plugin was uninstalled/installed. The second was affecting what would happen if 2 plugins with the same name were changed at the same time. Only one of the 2 plugins was showing up, now both are</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Further improve stability when a plugin is uninstalled both when the app is and is not running</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Add verbiage to Installed Plugin rescan screen to make it clearer that the preparation for rescan may take a couple minutes</li>
                    <li>Fix bug where enabling the Manufacturer filter for plugins but not actually selecting a manufacturer would cause a "Failed to perform search, received unexpected response with code: 400. Please try again." error message.</li>
                </ul>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Users will now receive an email, a macOS system notification, and a notification in the Notifications tab of Plugin Station when new plugins that they have installed are added to the Plugin Station database. These notifications serve to inform the user that they can now perform more operations with these plugins, and they are sent in batches by the Plugin Station admin that's performing the plugin creation. Clicking one of these system notifications will open Plugin Station and take the user to a screen with more details about it.</li>
